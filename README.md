StudentAPP is a user-friendly application developed as part of my practical Jenkins project lab.

The application is deployed using a Jenkins pipeline by integrating Maven for build automation and Apache Tomcat as the deployment server.

This project demonstrates the CI/CD process through automated builds, testing, and deployment.
